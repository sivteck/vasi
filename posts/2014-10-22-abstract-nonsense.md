I hereby declare this blog post as my trash can.
I will try to update frequently and better present the math expressions better in the far future.

Abstract Algebra
================

Set __A__ that has a binary operation __( * )__ defined on it can be represented as
__( A , * )__

That representation is called as a binary structure.

Monoid
------

Monoid is a binary structure __( M , * )__ satisfying the properties

1. ( a * b ) * c ==  a * ( b * c ) where __a, b and c__ are elements of __M__ <-- Associative
2. There is an element __e__ in __M__ such that __a * e == e * a__ where __ a __ is any element in __ M __ <-- __e__ is the identity element.

__Theorems__:

1. The identity element is unique.
 
Groups
======

Group is a Monoid __( G , * )__ with an additional property 

1. Every element __a__ in __G__ has an inverse __a'__.
__a * a' == a' * a = e__ where __e__ is the identity element.

Order of a Group G is denoted by __|G|__


__Theorems__:

1. The inverse of any element is unique
2.
