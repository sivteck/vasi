I hereby declare this blog post as my trash can.
I will try to update frequently and better present the math expressions better in the far future.

Abstract Algebra
================

Set __A__ that has a binary operation __( * )__ defined on it can be represented as
__( A , * )__

^ that thing is called a binary structure.

Monoid
------

Monoid is a binary structure __( M , * )__ satisfying the properties

1. ( a * b ) * c ==  a * ( b * c ) where __a, b and c__ are elements of __M__
2. There is an element __e__ in __M__ such that __a * e == e * a__ where __ a __ is any element in __ M __

__Theorems/Properties__:

1. The identity element is unique.
