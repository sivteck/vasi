title: GHC on Arch Linux ARM

GHC on Arch Linux ARM is currently broken because GHC-7.8.2 does not support 
LLVM 3.5 backend. I managed to get it working by using llvm 3.4.2 binaries from
[here](http://llvm.org/releases/3.4.2/clang+llvm-3.4.2-armv7a-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz)

Extract the archive, the llc and opt binaries will be in the bin folder. Make 
them executable with chmod +x command

GHC only needs the llc and opt binaries.

Copy the binaries to /usr/bin/

Now install GHC with

``` bash
pacman -S ghc --assume-installed llvm=3.5.1
```


Hopefully, GHC 7.10 will support LLVM 3.6 which was released recently
