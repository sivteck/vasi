Education Loans most likely have the highest interest rates. Hence to understand
how you will be paying it back might be useful. Paying off an educational loan 
of Rs. 4 lakh with a repayment period of 10 years on EMI will cost you Rs. 6090
per month. Paying this much amount while earning Rs. 12000/month will be
difficult. You have to pay it or the interest will keep accumulating.

Help people understand this before/after they take an education loan!
 
Examples:
=========

Yoda Rajendran- Rs. 3 Lakh
-----------------

Yoda Rajendran took an education loan of total Rs. 3 Lakhs for his engineering degree. 

Now he has to repay it. Lets assume he gets a job before 6 months after 
graduation. Most banks provide a moratorium period of minimum 6 months after
graduation. During this period Simple Interest is levied. Lets assume the
interest rate to be 13.5% p.a.

Total Interest amount during the 6 months = 3,00,000 * 13.5 * 6 / (12 * 100)
                                          = Rs. 20250

Since Yoda didn't pay the interest during the moratium period, the total
interest amount during that period is added to the principal amount.

New Principal amount = Rs. 3,20,250

Yoda's repayment period is 10 years.

Equated Monthly Installments (EMI)
    = 320250 * (13.5 / 1200) * (1 + (13.5/1200))^120 / ((1 + 13.5/1200)^120 - 1)
    = Rs. 4876.58

So, Yoda has to pay Rs. 4876.58 every month to repay his loan within 10 years.

Annakilli Skywalker - Rs. 15 Lakhs
----------------------------------

Annakilli Skywalker took a loan of Rs. 15 lakhs to pursue her MS in the USA. 

Lets assume an interest rate of 11.75% p.a. and a repayment period of 10 years.

Principal Amount = Rs. 15,00,000

Principal Amount after Moratorium Period of 6 months
                 = Rs. 88125 + Rs. 15,00,000 = Rs. 15,88,125

EMI              = Rs. 22101.77


Boring Stuff:
-------------

The point of this post is that you should really consider the worth of your
fancy foreign/MBA degree, if you have to take a loan. Don't go for below average
universities and expect high paying jobs. You most likely won't get a job there.

It's an expensive gamble. Consider your parents life after their retirement too!


Banks often allow a moratorium period of 6 months to 1 year after completing
your degree.

For example SBI, does [this](http://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/student-platform/student-loan):

In case of SBI Student loans, repayment will start after the completion of 
course period and moratorium period (Repayment commences one year after the
course completion or 6 months after securing a job, whichever is earlier).


During the Moratorium period, Simple Interest is calculated. After the 
moratorium period, the total interest is added to the principal amount
and the interest is levied for this total amount.

Repayment period is the number of years you and your bank has agreed to pay
off the loan.

After the Moratorium period compound interest is applied.
